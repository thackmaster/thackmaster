Prowlarr is an index manager that allows you to centralize management of your torrent and nzb indexers. Sonarr and Radarr can use this instead of having to manage each one seperately. Prowlarr is easy enough to setup on its own, and here's my `config.yml` file.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
    prowlarr: #overview management
        hostname: prowlarr
        image: lscr.io/linuxserver/prowlarr:develop
        container_name: prowlarr
        environment:
            - PUID=1000
            - PGID=1000
            - TZ=America/Denver
        volumes:
            - /home/prowlarr:/config:rw
        ports:
            - 35602:9696
        restart: unless-stopped
```
