Tautulli is not offically part of the *aar stack, but I think it's such a valuable tool to have that it should be. Tautulli provides further insight into your Plex server and streams, allowing for better monitoring. It can be installed on either the same machine running your Plex server or on a remote machine with API access to your server. With insights like who watched, what they watched, when they watched, how they watched, how long they watched, and what they used to watch, you won't be asking for additional data from your users since it is already provided and logged for later viewing. Notifications are also built-in and customizable, including when someone starts watching something, when Plex or Tautulli need an update, or even when a database corruption is detected.
