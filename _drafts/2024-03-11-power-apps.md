Power Apps is Microsoft's custom app-building platform. There are heavy limitations in what it can do and how it works, but is quite handy if needing to build an application internal to your company. Power Apps also allows you to export the application package for import at a later date. While Microsoft Docs[^ftn1] is a wealth of information, there are several caveats you may run into during app development that might trouble you, things that don't make sense or need a weird workaround you can't find anywhere else online. While I'm not going to include every Power Apps help site out there, I'll be linking my favorites at the bottom and on the [Resources](../../resources) page[^ftn2][^ftn3] along with my knowledge on how the platform works and operates, and my advice on best practices for efficient development and maintainence of apps.
