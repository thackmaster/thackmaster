There are many different resources floating around on the internet. Some of them are good, fantastic even. Others may be out of date, or poorly written (or even worse, non-existent). Here are my personal favorites of sites that provide amazing insight into what they do best. Whether that's using/managing Docker, how things works, server management, walkthroughs/tutorials, or even some light coding, there's someone out there with the experience on that.
