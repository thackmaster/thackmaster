# Who am I?
I'm a random internet enigma that you could probably find more about if you wanted to. I've been playing around with computers since I could walk. There are several self-hosting projects I have done in the past, and am currently hosting. Hopefully my experience and documentation can help someone else out that may need it.

# This Site
You've probably seen sites that look very similar to this, and that's okay. As shown in the footer, I am using the Jekyll theme Chirpy and host the site via GitHub Pages. All of the walkthroughs/documentations are done on my local setup and while I will do my best to document variations I discovered and used, every technical environment is unique and may require some personal workarounds. And although everything listed here can be configured additionally for public listings, I won't be listing them here.

# How can I contact you?
All of my platforms are listed in the bottom left corner of this site (or the bottom of the sidebar for mobile users). They're the best ways to reach me directly. Or you comment on any article and myself or the community will assist! Or open a new discussion on the GitHub repo.

# Disclaimer
Most - if not all - pages on this site were tested on one of my HP machines and are written to follow such. Most of the time, these will be written to follow Docker through Portainer on Debian 11 and run on the assumption of such. Using these walkthroughs does not provide a guarantee that they will work as expected, nor that they will provide security against threats as configured. Use at your own risk.
